BareBones Template
==================

The BareBones template is my starting point for new projects. It provides a
great setup for frontend technology and can be plugged in with any backend
quickly. My instructions will be based on a unix operating system as it's what
I know.

Getting Setup
-------------

First off make sure you have ruby installed:

    sudo apt-get install ruby-full rubygems1.8

Once that's done, install SASS, Compass, and CoffeeScript:

    sudo gem install sass compass coffee-script

Run Watcher scripts:

    bash bin/run.sh

Features
--------

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - Because it's so useful.
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - Because it's the future of data-driven
  front-end frameworks.
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - Because it makes writing all
  things JavaScript easier.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - For quick scaffolding.
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - Making writing CSS less painful.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - Making compiling SASS super easy.
